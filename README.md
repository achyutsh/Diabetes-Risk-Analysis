# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Analysis – Exploratory Data Project

This project analyzes a synthetic healthcare dataset of 10,000 individuals to explore patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes. We use visual and statistical analysis to uncover how biometric and lifestyle indicators impact health risk levels such as prediabetes and diabetes.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze relationships between **HbA1c**, **BMI**, **glucose**, and other health indicators
- Explore risk segmentation based on **HbA1c levels**
- Visualize impact of gender, physical activity, and lifestyle factors on diabetes risk
- Identify insights that can be useful for healthcare professionals or patients

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Dataset format: CSV (synthetic healthcare data)
